Hello,

This git repository contains various files to be used with GeekTool or NerdTool or Conky.
Essentially, they are small scripts that provide useful output of certain system information.
E.g.: Hard Drive Space, Temperature, Battery Info, etc.

The vast majority is text-oriented, but there are also quite a few, neat graphical implementations.
To use the scripts:
  1. Clone this git repository (or copy-paste the code into a file)
  2. Change paths that are hard-coded in the files (needed for things like images)
  3. Change certain info contained in the file (locations for weather-display)
  4. Run the scripts. Their output will tell you what to do.

## Tips
 - If you want anti-aliased fonts in GeekTool, use shadows. Shadows force anti-aliasing. Go to the fonts window and set the shadow slider to nearly zero.
